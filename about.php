                            I am a web developer seeking my first professional opportunity. I'm
                            very passionate and cannot wait to get my career started. I started learning web
                            development in early 2015 and have been creating projects/going through tutorials ever since.  Refer to my portfolio page
                            to see my experience, but I really just enjoy coding and learning as much as possible.  I have experience 
                            with a lot of different languages, software, and technologies.

                    <h2>Mortgage Loan Officer for A+ Mortgage</h2>
                    <p>This past year, working for A+ Mortgage has taught me so many invaluable lessons. On top of my
                        Loan Officer responsibilities, I took on a role of developing our website in order to boost our
                        online presence. It really has taught me a lot about what it takes to start a business, and how 
                        to find new clients online through SEO, social media, and online interaction.</p>

                    <h2>Web Developer</h2>
                    <p>I've really tried to expand my knowledge of the entire web development industry so that whatever
                        role I take on at my first job, I will be able to hit the ground running.  I feel very comforatble
                        working in the front end of applications, and I understand how all the pieces of the full stack
                        fit together.  To increase my knowledge and skill set, I find project-based tutorials that use technologies
                        that I am unfamiliar with, go through them, and then re-create them in order to master the concepts.  This has 
                        helped me learn not just about languages, but how good developers code and structure their applications.</p>

                    <p>When I first moved down to Texas, I was looking for a labor position temporarily
                        until I found a sales position.  I ended up getting a job at White Glove, and I 
                        enjoyed it so much that I stayed for almost three years. I worked in and out of million
                        dollar homes, doing everything from full home transfers to high end furniture delivery. 
                        I learned so much about teamwork, attention to detail, and how to disassemble and reassemble
                        furniture. </p>

                    <p>I graduated from the University of Missouri with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration and an emphasis in marketing.
                    I also walked on to the football team and earned a scholarship and was a two year letterwinner.  By being a part of a top level division
                    1 football program, and putting in so many hours of hard work, I really learned the level of intensity and hours of work that it takes
                    to be successful at anything.  I have applied a lot of these concepts to learning web development and I believe that this is one of the
                    factors that has allowed me grow my skills to the level that they are currently.</p>

                       JavaScript. I have used the header() and footer() PHP functions, as 
                       well as many more PHP techniques on this site, including the contact 
                       form.  Please reference my Github account to access the code for this

                    <h4>This is the website for my current employer, A+ Mortgage</h4>
                    <p>When I first started as a Loan Officer in July of 2016, our branch needed
                        a website, so I stepped up and created  APlusMortgages.com. My goal was to attract
                        business and create a professional site for our branch.  I created the site using Wordpress, HTML/CSS, along
                        with a number of plugins.  This site has given me so much experience and such a great opportunity to grow my 
                        skills as a developer.  As my skills increased, I kept going back and revising the site to reflect my current skills
                        set.  Currently, I am working on creating my own Wordpress Theme in PHP, HTML, and CSS and using that code as the site
                        so that I won't need as many plugins.  I plan on getting that implemented soon.  Stay tuned! </p>

                    <h3><b>Social Media Manager</b></h3>
                    <h4>This was one of my first Angular Projects.</h4>
                    <p>One of the ways I go about learning new skills is by finding project based tutorials
                        online, coding along, and then re-creating the project and making it my own.  This is
                        one of those projects.  This is just the front end of a "Social Media Manager" that
                        would essentially allow you to create posts on your Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts.
                        I created this project using Angular, Node.js, Bootstrap, jQuery and HTML/CSS.  I have provided
                        a link to the code below. </p>

                <h4>This page was created by converting a PSD file to HTML/CSS</h2>
                <p>Another one of the ways I go about practicing my front end skills is to find
                    PSD files online and convert them to HTML/CSS.  This is one of the projects
                    that I used to practice.  These types of exercises have allowed me to grow
                    as a developer by making me more efficient.  Because of projects like this, I 
                    am able to create pages faster and easier while still maintaining accurate and 
                    responsive code. </p>

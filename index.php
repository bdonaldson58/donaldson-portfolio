        <p>I am a developer who lives in San Marcos, TX who is seeking a PHP/MySQL 
           position.  I have over 2.5 years experience in web development and have a 
           broad base of experience with different technologies, frameworks and languages.
           I am open to other positions besides PHP/MySQL because at this point, experience 
           is more important to me than anything.  However, I am passionate about PHP and it is 
           my goal to take my career in that direction. </p>

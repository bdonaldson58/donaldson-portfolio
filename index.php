        <p>I am a developer who lives in San Marcos, TX who is seeking a web developer 
           position.  I have over 2.5 years experience in web development and have a 
           broad base of experience with different technologies, frameworks and languages.
           My goal is to land a position working as more of a back end developer using
            PHP and SQL but I am open to many different positions because at this point 
            in my career, experience is more important to me than anything. </p>
